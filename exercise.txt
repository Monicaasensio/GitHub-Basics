Github Basics:

1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.
2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?
3. What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?

1.	The terminal on a computer is the interface, or input box, for text commands. 
    Using the terminal makes developers more time efficient. Also, the terminal allows you to complete 
    many tasks, such as opening documents, as well as opening and creating folders and files.
    Essentially, a terminal is a way for us to communicate with the computer.

2.	Git is a distributed version control system (A way that programmers can track their code changes).
    Git is the most widely accepted version control system because most of its operations are local, 
    making it super fast. Git includes text editors, bug tracking systems, and build servers. 
    This differs from GitHub. GitHub is the most popular Git repository hosting service. 
    It offers unlimited free repositories and include features like issue tracking, web pages, and 
    source code snippet sharing to support developer projects that are hosted on the service. 
    GitHub is super useful because you can host your repository online, making it easy to collaborate 
    in groups, and to organize a portfolio for potential employers. In conclusion, Git lets you manage 
    and keep track of your code history, while GitHub lets you manage your Git repositories by pushing
    your code to the online hosting service. 

3.	To fork a GitHub repository (forking gives you the ability to make a pull request or branch off 
    the original code), you first need to select the fork button in GitHub on the page of the 
    original code. Next, in the pop-up screen, click the account you would like to access the fork 
    with. The repo will go under this personal GitHub account, and you now have control to change the 
    code. These changes will be part of the repository you forked into your account. If you wanted to 
    add the changes to the original base/code, you can create a pull request that will be sent to the 
    originator of the code.
